# scryfall-unofficial-ios
Unofficial iOS client for Scryfall service.

## Disclaimer
This project was (half-)done as I was learning RxSwift. It is in basic working condition, but there's a lot to improve in terms of code structure and quality.

## Main features
- Basic search with support of Scryfall's query language
- List and Cards search results presentation
- Card details screen with working links from card's details back to filtered search
- Caching of search results and card images
